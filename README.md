# ProductManagementSystem
Warehouse/stock managers can use this application to manage their products, either graphically or in the terminal. Users can add and remove products, as well as the clients purchasing them, change the price of products, and see the overall value of their stock. They can also save and load data that was previously entered, implemented using JSON.
