# Product Management Project

## Uses of the Application
Company managers can use this product management system to keep track of their 
stock. They can add stock as it gets shipped in, as well as remove stock from 
the system when it is sold to customers. Using this application, they can keep
track of their stock and stay organized, reducing the chance of any lost or
extra stock, possibly resulting in wasted money.

## Why did I choose to make this project?
I have always been curious as to how a company keeps track of its products once
it grows to a big size. I also want to be a part of this management process in 
some capacity in my career. Working on this project would allow me to familiarize
myself with the basic idea of keeping stock organized.
